Yet Another LiDar Project
-------------------------

I wanted a way to use my RPLIDAR A1M8 Lidar on my Android phone. After searching and trying Arduino's, I eventually decided to create an APP.

Not sure if this will work with any other RPLIDAR as I dont have any yet.

This is the start of creating this project. I have used https://github.com/carlemil/RPLidarA2AndroidThingsAPI and thank him for the 
development he did. If you use this , please give him a star.

Even though the aar is for the long dead Android IOT, I have tried to utilise the aar as much as I can.
