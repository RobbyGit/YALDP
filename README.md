Yet Another LiDar Project
-------------------------

I wanted a way to use my RPLIDAR A1M8 Lidar on my Android phone. After searching and trying Arduino's, I eventually decided to create an APP.
This used the OTA function and plugs directly into the FTDI USB port of the RPLIDAR. If your phone does not support OTA, then this will not work.


Not sure if this will work with any other RPLIDAR as I don't have any yet.

I have used https://github.com/carlemil/RPLidarA2AndroidThingsAPI and thank him for the development he did. If you use this , please give him a star.

Even though the aar is for the long dead Android IOT, I have tried to utilise the aar as much as I can.
Im sure there are so many things that can be done better and I will work through them.

Things to do:
--------------
1. Turn on and off the motor
2. Add a view that can zoom and move
3. Check data integrate better
